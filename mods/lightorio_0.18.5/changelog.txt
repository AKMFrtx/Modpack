Version: 0.18.1
Date: 2020.04.19

  Bugfixes:
    - Made a more stable fix for lamps added to miner drills for modded drills. Hopefully this is the end of drill-related rotation crashes.
    - Previously it was possible to set the assember-light switch on light level to be less than the switch off light level, which is disallowed at the prototype level, and will cause the mod to crash on load. This has been fixed - configurations of this type will default the darkness for all lamps on to be 1, so the mod will still load.
