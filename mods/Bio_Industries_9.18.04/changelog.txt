Version: 0.18.04
Date: 2020-02-16
  Uploaded by:
    - Pi-C

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that prototype artillery couldn't be fed by inserters (Order is important: first the hidden radar must be created, then the cannon!).
      (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5dcc0996863888000b1b1900)

    - Fixed that prototype artillery couldn't be blueprinted.

  TODO:
    - Add an alternative way to produce plastic without fluids. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e3f5fadc359e6000d54cfb2)

Version: 0.18.03
Date: 2020-02-12
  Uploaded by:
    - Pi-C

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash with base mod 0.18.2 and 0.18.3. Bio Industries referenced sounds that didn't exist before Factorio 0.18.4; didn't catch that because I already was on the latest version.
      (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e420af6efb7b9000d898545)

  Changes:
    - Bumped dependency on the base mod to ">=0.18.2" because of the sound changes in 0.18.2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.02
Date: 2020-02-11
  Uploaded by:
    - Pi-C

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash with "Pyanodons Coal Processing": its graphics have been moved to "Pyanodons Coal Processing Graphics" recently, so "Bio Industries" referenced files that didn't exist.

  Changes:
    - BI uses the icon for ash from "Pyanodons Coal Processing" (PCP) if that mod is active. However, the icon for ash from BI was still used in the icons of BI-recipes that have ash as ingredient. I made alternative versions of these icons that are based on PCP's icon for a more coherent look.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.01
Date: 2020-02-10
  Info:
    - TheSAguy asked me (Pi-C) to look after his mod for a while, so this is my first release of a "Bio Industries" update.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed inconsistency in labels of unlocked recipes for Biofuel Conversion 2, 3. (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=80546)

    - Fixed that terraformers wouldn't plant on landfill. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e1bd9b7e60b78000d1b8c1b)

    - Fixed that terraformers couldn't be blueprinted. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5dbbf3f05ba8c1000ccf008a)

    - Fixed that names of items and recipes didn't match. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5ca1534d3f02c6000d51b9b8)

    - Bumped dependency on Factorio Standard Library (stdlib) to >=1.4.0. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e34215f78fa0a000c20822c)

  Changes:
    - Changed prerequisite technologies for Coal processing 2 (added Chemical science pack) and 3 (added Production science pack). (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5dcd0fa3797d9c000cb993f2)

    - Added recipes to make crushed stone from Concrete, Hazard concrete and their refined-concrete counterparts. They can be made in the stone crusher after "Advanced Material Processing 2" has been researched (processing stone takes 1.5s, vs. 2.5s for concrete/hazard concrete; processing the refined-concrete varieties will yield twice the amount, but take twice the time). I've also added "Concrete" to the prerequisites of "Advanced Material Processing 2". (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5e11565b6cc0eb000b9732bc)

    - If Dectorio is installed, you won't be able any longer to place wood on the ground as wooden flooring. However, any existing wooden flooring will remain in place and can be mined (returning wood). (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5d7e610164c43b000c4e23a6)

    - Reduced supply area of Big wooden pole (4x4 to 3x3) and Huge electric pole (4x4 to 2x2). Also changed name of "Huge electric pole" to "Huge wooden pole" for consistency. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5d7d35d2e18d8c000bb016c0/edit_title)

    - Removed fuel value from ash.

    - Added bioreactor to blacklist of Assembler Pipe Passthrough to avoid crashes on migration because of mixing fluids. (It used to be blacklisted in APP already, but with the changes to prototype names it's easier if we blacklist our own stuff directly.)

    - Changed icon for recipe of Bio battery -- it still used the battery icon from Factorio 0.16.x.

    - Changed graphics for Power-to-rail connector. Now it resembles a medium electric pole (like in the icon) -- not a small electric pole.

    - Allow productivity modules when making Production science packs with the BI recipe. (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries/discussion/5da3445450a256000b56f116)

    - Unified format of datestrings and merged categories "Bugfix:"/"Bugfixes:" in the changelog.

  Locale:
    - Changed item-description of "Change terrain (advanced)" and "Change terrain & plant trees (advanced)" to explain the advantages over the basic recipe.

    - Changed a lot of prototype names. Check out migrations/Bio_Industries_0.18.01.json for a complete list of the new names!
